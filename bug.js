The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the rules in your Firebase project's `database.rules.json` file are too restrictive or incorrectly configured. This could lead to unexpected behavior, where data isn't saved or fetched correctly, even if your client-side code appears to be functioning properly.  For instance, if your rules don't allow writes from the client's authentication UID, writes will fail silently, or you may encounter a permission denied error.
